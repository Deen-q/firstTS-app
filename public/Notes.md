- Snowpack is a bundler --> needed so browser can access node_modules folder (bundles the folder so browser can understand it)
- without a bundler, we cannot use node modules (e.g., cannot use 'npm i uuid4')
- All files were deleted, if any, then 'npx create-snowpack-app . --template @snowpack/app-template-blank-typescript' was used
- '.' means it occurs in this folder. '--force' to enable that, if it gives an error.
- 'npm start' used (opens on localhost:8080)
